## Windows TinyPDBParser
<hr>

## How? why? <br>
This will use Imagehlp.dll to Enum all PDB symbols and gives you the needed data to work with.
<br><br>
This project was a part of another project for `Removing Kernel Callbacks`, So I decided to make the PDB Enum part opensource maybe someone will learn a new trick üòÅ.

### Updates!

I don't think I'll update this project again, because no need to.
